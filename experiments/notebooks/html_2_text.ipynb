Pain and\\nsuffering could be related to chronic, incurable diseases like cancer, renal\\ndisease and heart failure. It is normal for owners to elect to make the choice\\nthat they feel is kindest for their terminally ill pets. Euthanasia is\\nperformed by a veterinarian, and done for reasons such as humane relief of\\nsuffering. The decision to put your pet down is typically made when the animal\\nis starting to suffer as a result of the condition and when drugs can no\\nlonger bring enough pain relief, or due to owner’s financial limitations to\\nprovide care for life threatening illnesses that may cause suffering.\\nExcessive vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal pain, severe arthritis, tumors or\\ncancer can all lead to these painful symptoms and complete body failure. In\\nthese cases, it is much kinder to put the pet to sleep and end their pain.\\nDuring the euthanasia process, your pet would be injected with a chemical that\\nwhen it enters the blood stream it stops the function of both the heart and\\nthe brain, which causes instant loss of consciousness and pain sensations.\\nThis is where the term “put to sleep” comes from as the animal falls into a\\ndeep sleep and the heart stops beating, allowing the pet to pass without\\nexperiencing pain. We offer communal cremation where your pet’s remains would\\nbe spread on a farm up north, or we also have an individual cremation option\\nfor you to have your pet’s ashes returned to you in a cedar wood urn.\\n\\nHyperbaric Oxygen Therapy\\n\\nA medical treatment useful in a variety of clinical situations. The patient is\\nplaced safely and comfortably in a large chamber. 100% oxygen flows into the\\nchamber under pressures 1.5 to 3 times that of normal atmospheric pressure.\\nTreatments may last from 1 to 2 hours and are given 1 to 3 times daily, with\\nat least 4 hours between sessions. Most patients require no sedation and\\nappear calm and relaxed during HBOT treatment sessions. The total number of\\nHBOT treatments necessary will vary according to the type of disease and/or\\npatient response.\\n\\nIn Home Pet Euthanasia\\n\\nIn Home Pet Euthanasia – Most pets have difficulty getting around in their old\\nage, so it can be quite troublesome to get them in the car and bring them into\\nthe veterinarian. Many pet owners may want the privacy and comfort of being in\\ntheir own home when making this decision. Sometimes pet parents are too upset\\nto drive, and having us come to their home eliminates many of these concerns.\\nOur veterinarians offer this service to come to you and your pet at home, in\\nhopes this will help you and your family during these sensitive moments. We\\nhope that you and your family will be more relaxed in the privacy of your own\\nhome, and we strive to ensure our visit to your home goes as peacefully as\\npossible for your family. Don’t hesitate to call us today at 480-945-8484 for\\nany questions regarding your decision to say farewell to your furry loved one.\\nWe are here for you every step of the way, and offer this service to our\\nclients who live within 8 miles of our practice.
